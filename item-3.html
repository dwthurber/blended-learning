		<h2>Faculty Development</h2>
        
		<em>Faculty involvement in the instructional design process is critical, but amount of time may have less of an impact than the quality of those interactions and the openness of faculty to changing course designs and teaching practices for the unique blended learning format.</em>
        
        <h3>In Brief</h3>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Instructional designers follow a structured course design process,</strong> which based on the ADDIE model, emphasizes faculty involvement and ongoing evaluation. While the process is structured, course development is not ‘one size fits all’ - each course is approached individually.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Course designs benefit from both the quantity and quality of meetings between the faculty and instructional designers.</strong> Emphasis is placed on approaching each meeting with a clear focus and providing faculty with ideas for evidence-based learning activities.   
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Faculty are provided with ongoing resources,</strong> including technical support during synchronous sessions and continual access to instructional designers.
        </p>
        
		<h3>Detail</h3>
        
		<p>
			From the beginning, the higher education program and instructional designers approached course design, development, and implementation as a highly individualized process. Instructional designers encouraged numerous meetings following a structured Instructional Design process developed and implementing internally based on the ADDIE model for Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Analysis (see Figure 1).

			The assumption was that if faculty engaged more in the overall process of course design, the course would see an increased quantity and quality of interaction between peers and each other and peers and the instructor as well as higher reported levels of overall satisfaction. To test this assumption, the researchers estimated the number of hours instructional designers spent working directly with faculty in each stage of the ADDIE design process. However, in annecdotal feedback, this comparison does not appear to yield any relationship to reported course satisfaction or interaction. For example, instructional designers worked closely with the instructor for Course 1, but that course had some of the lowest reported levels and quality of interaction. Course 3, on the other hand, was completed with fewer meetings total than three of the four other courses, but the quality of those interactions and the willingness of the instructor to engage in meaningful redesign of the course for the blended format likely contributed significantly to the high satisfaction and engagement reported in this class. Ultimately, it appeared that courses which were more deliberately designed for a blended format, i.e. courses 3 and 4, and those which had faculty that worked more closely with instructional designers to learn best practices in teaching strategies (i.e. course 3) had higher overall ratings.

			We also provided ongoing support to faculty throughout the course. Instructional designers were present at every online synchronous class session to manage the technological needs of the class and address any technology issues that arose with faculty or students. This was done to alleviate the need for faculty to focus on technology issues alongside teaching. In interviews with faculty, this was cited as one of the most beneficial aspects of the overall teaching experience in the blended format and several instructors said they couldn't imagine teaching without this support.
