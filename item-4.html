		<h2>Student Support</h2>
		<em>Students' reasons for taking a blended format course (i.e. wanting to take the course vs being required to take it) may be less important to their experience in the course than how training on technology and ways of participating in the course.</em>
        
        <h3>In Brief</h3>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Students are required to attend a technology orientation</strong> before their first blended course. Familiarizing students with the platform minimizes technical issues during the online sessions, helps facilitate smoother class discussions, and lowers the cognitive demand on students (they are able to focus on the content, not the technology). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Courses include <strong>expectation-setting information regarding the benefits and challenges of the online/blended format.</strong>   
        </p>
        
		<h3>Detail</h3>
        
        <p>
			The blended format courses were targeted at certificate students who might work full time or travel extensively for work and thus have difficulty making it to campus for class every week. However, other traditional master's degree students were either required (Course 4) or elected to take the blended format of another course. We assumed that students would rate the course more highly if they elected for the blended learning format; however, there is no apparent correlation between the reason for selecting a blended course and overall satisfaction of students in that course.

			As figure 1 shows, students were asked what their primary reasons for electing in a course were. Responses were grouped based on whether the response indicated they elected into the course or didn't. There were four reasons identified for students electing into the course: (1) format was preferred for the learning style, (2) job responsibilities made it difficult to come to class on campus, (3) family or travel made it difficult to come to class on campus, and (4) commute made it difficult to come to class on campus. The remaining reasons were classified as electing for the course and not the blended learning format, including (1) it was the only available option, (2) chose the instructor and not the modality, and (3) it was required. Based on this classification, the data does not support any clear trend in satisfaction based an reasons for electing to take a course. For example, students who said they chose the instructor and not the modality had some of the highest rates of satisfaction overall, lending credence to the idea that ultimately, the instructor has more impact than the format.

			The second area within this section was based on the assumption--grounded in the literature--that students needed support and training on using the technology tools used in the program. To meet this need, every student was required to complete on online technology orientation. This orientation was 15-30 minutes long and conducted within the same teleconferencing platform as online synchronous class session (Adobe Connect). Students were asked to login and then walked through completing several of the standard function of participating in a class, including muting and muting their phone line, enabling their webcams, participating in chat and whiteboards, and sorting into breakout rooms.

        <blockquote>
            ...this course was run to its absolute highest potential.  The tech team and instructor did an amazing job coming up with creative solutions  to meet the courses learning goals to the best of their ability" 
        </blockquote>
        <p>
			Students reported a high level of comfort with the technology used and the support provided. In survey responses, students were asked to provide any examples of additional support or resources they would have appreciated. After coding these qualitative responses, only 3 out of 47 responses across all four courses indicated any additional support or resources could have been provided. Of those, only one response related to technology support provided. That student wanted tips on how to stay focused while the camera was turned off in online class session. Several responses indicated a positive experience with the technology support and resources provided.
